# CSCI396

Please note I am taking this course as 0.5 credits.

## Course Description

A broad-ranging exploration of topics in computer networks that includes history,
communications theory, network architectures, internet protocols, client-server models, strategies for improving network security, and the social impact of modern networking. The course emphasizes both theory and
practice and therefore includes both mathematical analysis and programming projects written in Python.

## Objectives and Goals

We will learn principles underlying computer networks, using the internet as our
primary example. Following a network layer model (e.g., OSI and TCP/IP), starting at the application
layer and going downwards, we will explore popular protocols and mechanisms (e.g., TCP, DASH, routing,
checksums, congestion control) analyzing how and why they work
